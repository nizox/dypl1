Dynamic Programming Languages Assignment 1
==========================================

Some files are required to run the code but basically it consists in a parser
and a runtime environment for a simple DSL called [Turtle Graphics][1].

The project is written for Jython. The subject and the required
files can be downloaded from the [course website][2].

Try it:

    $ jar -xf assignment.jar # only the first time
    $ jython Turtle.py
